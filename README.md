# E-COMMERCE-BASED-ON-MICROSERVICES

i will use a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own data/db) and 
implementing different approaches within each microservice (simple CRUD vs. DDD/CQRS patterns) using Http as the
 communication protocol between the client apps and the microservices and supports asynchronous communication for
 data updates propagation across multiple services based on Integration Events and an Event Bus.
